# College Email Registration System

### Introduction

The College Email Registration System is a dedicated solution for email registration within our college domain. This project enables teachers and college students to register for email accounts seamlessly. The system simplifies the registration process by only requiring the username or Roll number for students. Upon registration, an OTP (One-Time Password) is automatically sent to the user's email address. Using this OTP, the user can log in and receive their new login credentials in the form of a QR code via email.
### Features

- User Authentication: Only authorized users, including teachers and college students, can register for email accounts.
- Simple Registration Process: Users can register by providing their username or Roll number.
- Email Verification: An OTP is sent to the user's email address for verification during the registration process.
- Login with OTP: Users can log in using the OTP received in their email.
